                My name is Kristen Killingsworth. I am a full-stack developer currently looking for work. I have a bachelors in the fine arts that I received in 2020 from the University of Washington. After graduation, the job market was in a tough spot post pandemic, and I found that my chosen career path was not fullfilling my needs. I decided to make a drastic change and enroll in the University of Washington Coding Bootcamp.

                I was familiar with the concept of a coding bootcamp as part of my coursework for my bachelors was doing a reasearch project working with a local organization (Skillspire) to document their work towards creating opportunities for people of color and women in the tech space.
