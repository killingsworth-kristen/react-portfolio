# React Portfolio
This is my professional portfolio created with React.

## Installation
My portfolio can be accessed at this URL without any need for installations. If you wish to open it locally after downloading the repo, you will have to run <code>npm i</code> and the <code>npm start</code> to install the packages and start the react app. 

## Usage
There are four nav tabs in the nav bar all labelled accodringly.

The "About me" section has a short personal statement about myself.

The "Portfolio" section has a carousel that has static images of my work, with a title and description. If you click on the image it will take you to the deployed link (if available) or to the github repo for the back end/command line projects.

The "Contact" section has a few various methods of reaching me. 

## Contributions
Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or inquiries. My information is listed in the "contact" section on my portfolio.
